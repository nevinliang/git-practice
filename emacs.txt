Descriptions:

Problem 1-
	I typed the hash id into the SHA1 ID box, and see 3 windows:
		the first was the entire history of the repository
		the second was the details of the merge, including author, committer
			parents, child, branches, and what it follows.
		the third window is just for patch comments/tree comments

Problem 2-
	Graph is on the pdf.

Problem 3-
	The visual difference between the one I cloned and the one that was in the
	~eggert/src/gnu/emacs folder in my linux server was that the one in the eggert
	folder had many, many more branches when run with git branch. The one I cloned
	and ran only had 1 branch, namely master. That means that we just have the master
	branch, not any of the branches that Dr. Eggert created. This is probably because
	he did not publish any of those branches so they are not in the Savannah repository
	and when we clone it we do not see any of them.

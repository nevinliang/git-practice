Problem Statement:
"Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."
- figure out how this statement was introduced into the tzdb files

I used the command:
	git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information." --oneline

And found out that the result/output was:
	c12b432 Eggert changes
	
This was the commit that introduced that change to the project.
If there was more than one line of output, it would be other changes that included 
those keywords, but there were none.

Looking at the commit c12b432, I can see that the commit was called Eggert changes
and it occured on July 18, 2012. It was authored by Arthur David Olsen and committed by
eggert. The commit hash was c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b.
